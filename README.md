Android mobile app in java using a custom view and canvas to draw and animate concepts in math, algorithms, and data structures.

Concepts implemented:

-BÃ©zier Curves
-A* Search Algorithm
-Dijkstra's Algorithm
-Stacks
-Queues
-Vector Projection
-Derivatives
-Integrals
-Taylor Series
-Maclaurin Series
-Insertion Sort
-Bubble Sort
-Selection Sort
-Heap Sort
-Lagrange Interpolation

Soon to come:

-linked lists, trees, heaps, graphs and convex hulls

Each concept is visualized with custom animations. Additionally, scroll views and a tab layout have been implemented to access each visualization.
